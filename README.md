## Installation

pkgs is a [go-ipfs plugin](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/plugins.md), which means the best way to use it is to build IPFS from source and follow the instructions for a preloaded plugin.

You'll have to do some `go.mod` edits to get everything to compile.

First, clone this repo into your `$GOPATH/src/github.com/underlay` folder (`$GOPATH` is usually `~/go`, but you can check with `go env GOPATH`).

```
mkdir -p $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/underlay/pkgs
git clone https://github.com/underlay/pkgs $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/underlay/pkgs
```

... and do the same for go-ipfs (make sure it's not already there)

```
mkdir -p $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs
git clone https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs
```

... then point the `underlay/pkgs/go.mod` reference to `go-ipfs` to your local `go-ipfs`:

```
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/underlay/pkgs
go mod edit -replace github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs
```

... then over in `ipfs/go-ipfs`, add `pkgs` to the `preload_list` and do the same replacement:

```
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs
echo 'pkgs github.com/underlay/pkgs/plugin *' >> plugin/loader/preload_list
go mod edit -replace github.com/underlay/pkgs $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/underlay/pkgs
make clean
make install
```

Then when you run `ipfs daemon --initialize` (assuming `ipfs` resolves to `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/ipfs`), we should see the pkgs plugin logs in the console:
